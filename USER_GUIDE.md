## Understanding Your Results

### Pain Points

The tool identifies three main pain points in your campaigns:
- **Keywords with no sales**: Keywords that are generating clicks but no conversions
- **Wasted spend**: The total amount spent on non-converting keywords
- **Low CTR keywords**: Keywords with click-through rates below 0.2%

### Recommendations

Recommendations are color-coded for easy understanding:
- **Red**: "Pause" - Keywords that should be paused due to poor performance
- **Green**: "Boost" - Profitable keywords that could benefit from increased bids
- **Yellow/Orange**: "Lower bid" - Keywords with ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sale) that's too high

### Priority Score

Each keyword is assigned a priority score (1-10) based on:
- Amount of spend
- Performance metrics
- Potential for improvement

Focus on keywords with higher priority scores first for the most impact.

### New Bid Suggestions

For keywords that need bid adjustments, the tool calculates optimal new bids based on:
- Current performance
- Target ACOS (35%)
- Minimum bid floor (€0.20)

### Match Type Recommendations

The tool analyzes performance across different match types (Broad, Phrase, Exact) and suggests:
- Moving keywords from Broad to Exact match when Exact performs better
- Shifting from Broad to Phrase match for improved targeting

### Negative Keyword Suggestions

Keywords with high spend and zero conversions are identified as potential negative keywords to prevent wasted spend.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Upload Weekly**: For the most accurate recommendations, upload your CSV export weekly
2. **Implement High Priority Changes First**: Focus on recommendations with higher priority scores
3. **Track Performance**: After making changes, monitor performance and upload new data to see improvements
4. **Consider Match Type Strategy**: Use a mix of match types for optimal campaign performance

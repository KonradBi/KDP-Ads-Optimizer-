          <p className="text-gray-300">
            KDP Ninja provides tools and analysis to help users optimize their Amazon Advertising campaigns, particularly for Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP). The Service analyzes data uploaded by the user (e.g., CSV files) and provides insights, recommendations, and suggested bid adjustments. These are intended as guidance only. The effectiveness of these recommendations depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including market conditions, ad creatives, Amazon's platform changes, and your specific product and campaign strategy. The Service does not guarantee any specific results, such as increased sales, profits, or reduced Advertising Cost of Sales (ACoS).
